For the course Algorithms and Datastructures on Institute of Computer Science, Copenhagen University, Denmark, we have implemented a number of datastructures and algorithms as well as tools for visualizing for use in the daily education.

The project is developed in Python and consists mainly of the modules:

  * datastructure library : A standard library of common datastructures.

  * visualisation library : Library used for visualising, in principle, arbitrary data structures.

  * examples library : examples of usage of datastructures with focus on visualizations, and algorithms' impact on datastructures at some step.
